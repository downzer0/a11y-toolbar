# a11y (accessibility) toolbar

## About
The accessibility toolbar provides basic controls allowing visitors to increase the contrast of a website, switch to a grayscale/desaturated view, or increase the size of the fonts. Cookies are stored for future visits and it doesn't impact styles outside of the scope of the toolbar unless requested.

Simply include the CSS and JS files on your site. It's that simple.

## Changelog

0.1.0 10 Jun 2016
* Removed AFontGarde and Modernizr as they are no longer necessary
* Removed the skip links as they may conflict with existing skip links
* Converted CSS to Sass partials for easier inclusion
* Compiled Sass partials into a single CSS file
* Using body classes to control presentation rather than swapping in/out stylesheets
* Re-wrote JavaScript to be more modular and have better integration with AMD setups
